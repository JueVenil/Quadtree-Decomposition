- Quadtree decomposition algorithm is implemented for generating 2D pixel elements in Finite Element Method (FEM) applications.

- in "Visualize.m" the process for using the QuadtreeDecompFEM objects to plot the output mesh is explained.

- the code for 3D mesh generation with Octree algorithm is also availble upon your request.
